The Centerpiece Spacer Collection vol 001 offers a set of 59 models for use with the [DDD Printable Wall Control System](../).  Centerpiece names start with the dimensions, roughly equivalent to inches as used on the Wall Control system.  A 2x4 Centerpiece is 2in in height and fits between sidepieces that are 4in apart.

Spacer parts are often used vertically between two side pieces to provide additional rigidity to an assembled solution when mounted on the wall board, but can also be used horizontally to act as a shelf.

This collection includes the following:

## Spacer Perforated

Models with 1/2" or 1" holes along the flat surface for additional rigidity, interesting aesthetics, or to possibly hold or mount things with 1/2" or 1" round features.

## Spacer Blank

Simple, blank models with connection pins on either side in various sizes.  Great choice for horizontal use as a shelf.

## Spacer Blank Flush

These spacers mount flush to both the back and front of the side pieces, which requires the use of 4 or 6 [4x10x8mm Pins](4x10x8mm Pin.stl) along the edges to connect them to a sidepiece. Another good choice for horizontal use as a shelf, I've also used these parts mounted vertically to provide a large flat surface for attaching adhesive-backed Velcro strips.

## Clip-on Spacer

Another flush-mount design requiring 4 or 6 [4x10x8mm Pins](4x10x8mm%20Pin.stl) for mounting between side pieces.  The Clip-on spacer provides a vertical surface set a few mm away from the wall panel  so that one can mount clip-on parts such as a tape measure.
