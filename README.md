# DDD Printable Wall Control System

The DDD Printable Wall Control project provides a wide range of modular pegboard hangers for use with the [Wall Control powder-coated steel pegboard solutions available on Amazon](https://amzn.to/35emTsm).  After much research I landed on Wall Control as a durable, high-strength and low-price organization solution which works with existing 1/4" standard pegboard pegs.  The panels also add 1" slots which allows for greater strength and rigidity for compatible hangers.  I've found their panels to be inexpensive, well-made, and available in a range of colors and sizes.

Wall Control sells [a line of high quality hanger accessories compatible with these slots](https://amzn.to/35fkhuu) and I've found them to be reasonably priced and of high quality.  However, printed solutions can offer a highly-customized solutions made at home for your own organization needs and can do so quickly and inexpensively.  One might consider leveraging both solutions as needs arise.

Centerpieces are designed to mount between a pair of sidepieces.  Centerpieces are designed to create custom hook, shelf, or hangar solutions which can snap into place between a variety of sidepieces.

The simplest use case to create a single hook might involve a sidepiece along with a retainer pin to help keep the part in place in the slot.

## About powder coated Wall Control Panels

Wall control panels are available in a range of colors or as a simple unpainted, steel sheet.  The plain steel panels are slightly thinner than the powder coated panels.  The catches designed into these models are designed to attach firmly to the powder coated panels, while unpainted panels might have a little more play due to the difference in panel thickness.
