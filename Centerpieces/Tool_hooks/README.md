Holds 13x 10mm-wide screwdrivers (or similar).  I like [Wiha precision tools](https://amzn.to/2GQ8ucA) and these were designed to fit.  Combine with [2x2 L brackets](../../Sidepieces/L_brackets/) and a [2x5 spacer](../../Centerpieces/Spacer_perforated/2x5%20Spacer%20perforated.stl).

### [2.25x2 Milwaukee 3/8" Cordless Ratchet](2.25x2%20Milwaukee%203-8%20Cordless%20Ratchet.stl)

Tool holder for the [Milwaukee 3/8" M12 Fuel Cordless Ratchet](https://amzn.to/2IsC9ZB).  Combine with 4x [4x8x10mm Pin](../Spacer_blank_flush/4x10x8mm%20Pin.stl) and a pair of [2x2 L brackets](../../Sidepieces/L_brackets/).

Holders for the [Wiha 33496 8-Piece T-Handle Hex Driver set](https://amzn.to/36gpuRK), split into two parts.  The [larger set](Wiha%20T-Handle%20M10%20M8%20M6%20M5.stl) needs to be set 3" away from the panel for the T-Handles to fit, so pair with [2x3 Angle brackets](../../Sidepieces/Angle_brackets/) and a [2x4 spacer](../../Centerpieces/Spacer_perforated/2x4%20Spacer%20perforated.stl).  The [smaller set](Wiha%20T-Handle%20M4%20M3%20M2.5%20M2.stl) can set closer to the wall if desired, using [2x2 Angle brackets](../../Sidepieces/Angle_brackets/) and a [2x3 spacer](../../Centerpieces/Spacer_perforated/2x3%20Spacer%20perforated.stl).

Print with [2x2 Angle brackets](../../Sidepieces/Angle_brackets/) and a [2x6 spacer](../../Centerpieces/Spacer_perforated/2x5%20Spacer%20perforated.stl).  The 6" span on this needs some strength, I recommend printing this one with 100% perimeters.  It'll take a while to print but the result will be plenty rigid.

## Printing notes

In most use cases, the centerpieces are loaded with a bending moment, which is only really a problem when using the longer (4"+) models.  Adding infill and perimeters can help with rigidity, but for most cases simply printing fast and cheap should work fine.  PLA is a good choice for maximum rigidity.
