## Centerpiece Tool Hooks Naming

## Printing notes

In most use cases, the centerpieces are loaded with a bending moment, which is only really a problem when using the longer (4"+) models.  Adding infill and perimeters can help with rigidity, but for most cases simply printing fast and cheap should work fine.  PLA is a good choice for maximum rigidity.
