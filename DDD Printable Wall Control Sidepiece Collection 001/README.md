# DDD Printable Wall Control Sidepiece Collection vol 001

The Sidepiece Collection vol 001 offers a set of models for use with the [DDD Printable Wall Control System](../).  Sidepiece names start with the dimensions, roughly equivalent to inches as used on the Wall Control system.  For example, a 2x4.5 Sidepiece is 2in in height and extends 4.25in out from the panel.

Sidepieces are used to connect to the Wall Control surface and extend forward out from the wall.  Sidepieces can work on their own with a retainer, offering a single model extended forward from the board which is often useful for things like a single hook.  Alternately, sidepieces can be hooked together via centerpieces to create a wide range of modular hanging solutions.

This collection includes the following sidepieces:

## 0.25 Retainers

Retainers are used when a sidepiece is used without one or more centerpieces, providing a secure fit against the Wall Control board.  Models are provided in 2/3/4/5/6 inch heights.

## Flats

Simple, flat-surface sidepieces allowing centerpieces to be mounted vertically against the Wall Control board.  Useful with flush-mounted sidepieces.
